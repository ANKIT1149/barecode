# Title

Barecode — Practice like it’s a real coding interview

# 1 Line Pitch

Disable autocomplete, hints, formatting & distractions. Run timed sessions.

## Features

# 🧠 Real Interview Environment

Interview Mode temporarily turns your VS Code into a real coding-interview editor by disabling intelligent assistance that doesn’t exist in interviews.
No shortcuts. No crutches. Just you and the problem.

# 🚫 Smart Assistance Disabled

When Interview Mode is ON, the extension automatically disables:

Autocomplete & inline suggestions

Trigger-based suggestions (. / ( / smart hints)

Parameter hints and function signatures

Auto-imports for JavaScript & TypeScript

Accept-suggestion-on-Enter behavior

Format-on-save and silent formatting

“Unused variable” visual hints

Extra problem decorations that guide you

This creates a distraction-free, interview-accurate coding experience.

# 🔄 Safe & Reversible (Your Settings Are Protected)

Barecode never permanently changes your editor.

Your original VS Code settings are backed up before activation

All settings are restored automatically when Interview Mode is turned OFF

If VS Code reloads or the session ends, the extension handles state cleanly

You stay in control — always.
